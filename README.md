It's a web app that uses the device camera and can capture a direct image or an inverted image, which auto-downloads to the device. Can be used for digitising negatives with a smartphone, although probably not great quality.

I mean, I'm not a dev, I have no idea what I am doing, but I started withe the basic code from this gist: https://gist.github.com/rand0mC0d3r/442ab777ad0bf2c91b6e67f6681a27d0, thanks to [@rand0mC0d3r](https://gist.github.com/rand0mC0d3r), and rounded it out into a web app, because my friend needs to digitalise negatives. Can you help me do things like make it auto crop? AI colour correction? Let the pull requests flow!
