It's a web app that uses the device camera and can capture a direct image or an inverted image, which auto-downloads to the device. Can be used for digitising negatives with a smartphone, although probably not great quality.

I mean, I'm not a dev, I have no idea what I am doing, but I got the code from somewhere because my friend needs to digitalise negatives. Can you help me do things like make it auto crop? AI colour correction? Let the pull requests flow!
